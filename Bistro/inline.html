<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<hr>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <i><dfn>sous vide</dfn></i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food <em>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</em> into a water bath that is <b>precisely</b> set to 
  <br>the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us <strong>before</strong> <time datetime="2026-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>
